It is your first day at Centralia College!  You are very excited about your classes and all of the new people you will
meet. But you do not know where to go, so you go into the first builing that you come to.
You enter through the door and it immediately slams behind you.  You turn around and there is a man glaring at you.
The tag on his shirt says Janitor.

"Oh that is just great!  I almost had this door latch fixed so we can get out of here when you came through it.
And then you let it shut behind you.  Now I will have to start all over again.  I have been trying to fix this all day,
but these whiny people keep interrupting me."

He studies you for a second and then continues, "You're new here aren't you?  I can tell because I can see you don't 
understand how things work around here.  I'll tell you what... you help me out with these people today so I can get some
work done without being interrupted again and I will forget our little encounter this time.  But, I have rules: Don't
make a mess in the rooms, you can only leave one item; and don't get hurt on the job, you may only carry one thing
at a time.

Go on, go through the door to the north and leave me to my work.  Come back here if you think you have helped everyone."
